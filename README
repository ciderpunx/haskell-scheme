This is my toy implementation of scheme. The core is largely based on
build yourself a scheme in 48 hours. But with some changes and extensions,
to help me learn stuff. Things like comments and float support (currently broken).

You need haskell-platform installed 
# aptitude install haskell-platform

For a recent ghc you cani build with
$ ghc -o scheme Main.hs

For an older haskell you'll need to do sopmething like this:
$ ghc -O --make -o scheme -main-is Main.main Main.hs

When you've done that you can run the REPL with:
$ ./scheme

You can run a scheme program with 
$ ./scheme program_name.scm

At the prompt you can load the embryonic standard lib with
$ (load "prelude.scm")

Note I might change the name from prelude, but need to research what it is 
usually called.
